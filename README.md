## functional hardwares

see [functionnal hardwares](docs/hardwares.md)

## Install

In your domoticz plugin folder:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Myriades-ll/ZW164_py_plugin.git

### Zwave-js-ui

Set the retain flag **ON** like in the picture below.

![retain flag][def_retain_flag]

This plugin don't use the autodiscovery. It has its own system. You may have to restart **zwave-js-ui** to get the retain working.

```Shell
sudo zwave-js-ui.restart
```

### Domoticz

Add the new hardware named **CCSoundSwitch through Zwave-JS-UI**. Fill required fields, then start the plugin.

Plugin initialization may take a few time; at most 30 seconds; it has to retrieve some data from hardware. See Domoticz logs to view what's done.

## Usage

For every endpoint in your hardware, the plugin will create 2 devices:

- the first to control the volume
- the second to select the sound you want to play

Each device represent the actual values of your hardware.

So first, adjust the volume and then select a sound to play it instantly.

## Limits

You can't change actual volume while playing a sound. It will change for the next sound.

If you turn off the volume, the endpoint won't play anymore sound; it will be skipped.

## Note

If you upgrade from version 1.0.0:

- stop the previous plugin
- delete it; highly recommanded
- install the new plugin; [see above](#install)
- add the new plugin as [described above](#domoticz)
